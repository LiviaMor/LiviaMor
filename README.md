## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Lívia**, also known as **Scarlet** in the digital world.  
I'm a seasoned **Orthodontist** transitioning into **Tech**, currently studying **Systems Analysis and Development** at **PUC-GO**.

My goal is to merge my healthcare background with innovative tech solutions — especially through Java development, with a focus on automation, data analysis, and intelligent systems.

I'm currently seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply and expand what I've been learning in practice. While my main focus is Java, I'm also exploring cybersecurity and mobile development to better understand the tech landscape.

I'm eager to grow within a collaborative team, contribute to real-world projects, and refine my skills through hands-on experience.
